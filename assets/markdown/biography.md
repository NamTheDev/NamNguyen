As a homeschooled student, my journey has been marked by <b>constant creative exploration</b>. I began with <b>drawing and piano at six</b>, then pursued <b>coding at twelve</b> and <b>saxophone at thirteen</b>. At fourteen, I discovered my passion for <b>filmmaking</b>, allowing me to blend visual, auditory, and storytelling skills.

Facing challenges has strengthened my resolve and deepened my <b>appreciation for the arts</b>. Homeschooling provided the freedom to intensely pursue my passions, fostering my talents and love for learning.

A quote that inspires me: "<i>In a world of constant change, the learner shall inherit the earth, while the learned find themselves perfectly suited for a world that no longer exists.</i>" It reflects my commitment to <b>continuous growth and adaptability</b>.

As I develop my skills in <b>filmmaking, music, coding, and visual arts</b>, Iâ€™m excited to see how these interests shape my future. I remain dedicated to <b>pushing creative boundaries</b> and exploring new ways to express myself across various mediums.
